<p>Long ago, the world was nothing but an endless sea cloaked in a boundless sky,</p>
<p>stretching as far as could possibly be imagined. Then, two great titans came into existence.</p>
<p>The Bionis, and the Mechonis. The titans were locked in a timeless battle, </p>
<p>until at last only their lifeless corpses remained.</p>
